## Description
This code is an emotion-sensing program that detects facial emotions in a given image or webcam and draws bounding boxes and text based on those emotions. The code analyzes emotions in real time in an image or webcam and displays the results visually.

#### Note
The code assumes the existence of certain utility functions and model files (like Haar Cascade file, emotion model file, etc.) that are not provided in the code snippet. Ensure that these dependencies are satisfied for the code to run successfully.
